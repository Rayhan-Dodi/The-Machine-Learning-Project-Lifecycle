# 🧠 The Machine Learning Project Lifecycle - Final Project

Welcome to the **Final Project** on the **Machine Learning Project Lifecycle**. This repository demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to model deployment. It is designed as a hands-on implementation of theoretical ML lifecycle concepts.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to walk through all essential phases of a machine learning project's lifecycle by applying practical skills to a real dataset. This includes:

- Understanding the problem
- Data collection and exploration
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Model evaluation
- Model saving and possible deployment
